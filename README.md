## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 2000 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

    php composer-setup.php
    php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
    mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
    ```

## 3. Choose Your Local Development Environment

You have several options for your local development environment:

### a. XAMPP (Cross-Platform)

- **Download XAMPP**: [XAMPP Downloads](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

### b. LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)

## 4. Laravel Application

Clone your Laravel application from a Git repository or copy it to your local environment.

## 5. Configure Laravel

You need to configure your Laravel application to use the PHP version and database provided by your selected environment (XAMPP, LAMP, Laragon, or LEMP). Update your `.env` file to match your environment's settings.
